The main characters of the YaHoSino are the thief and the policeman. Of thief there is only one, but in the future (since the game is open source) you could think of adding more characters allied to the thief. 
As for the policeman, there could be more than one. This depends on the level. 

## Inspirations
 At first, we didn't want to develop the usual guard-guard game, but wanted to put some inventiveness into it. To do this we based ourselves on 2 main games, namely, Lucky Looter and Meal Gear Solid 2. 

### Lucky Looter
